If using Native OSX windowing:
------------------------------------
Install xcode
Install dependencies (OpenCV)
Open xcode project and select target (example) to run.  All example targets will automatically build the libgasandbox.a dependency, so it can either be built explicitly by choosing its target else it will be built implicitly the first time any of the examples are built.


If using X11:
------------------------------------
Install xcode (for the GCC compiler)
Install X11
Install darwin ports
Install automake, autoconf, glut, fltk

Copy /etc/xinitrc to ~/.xinitrc
Add lines to .xinitrc:

#This extra for building ga_sandbox
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib $LDFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include -I/usr/X11R6/include $CPPFLAGS"
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include -I/usr/X11R6/include $CFLAGS"
