20080324 `Fixed' precision problem in chap15/ex1/chap15ex1.cpp
		The line: draw(g_primitives[i], (i > 0) ? 1e-5 : 1e-3);

20080324 Fixed chap14/ex4/chap14ex4.cpp
		void menuCallback(int value) { 
			if (value >= 0) // Fixed this line
			// . . . 
		}
20080324 Added a comment to chap12/ex3/reconstruct.cpp
		h3ga::vector rD2 = _vector(D1 << Ii); // actually computes minus reciprocal of D2
20080324 Fixed code in chap12ex1.cpp point, in the for lines following the comment
			// compute images of basis vectors:
		The 'bug' in the old code had no effect though as the (T ^ (e0 << (R * X * Ri))) part is always 0
		for e1, e2 ,e3 and for e0, the rotor R does not affect it.
