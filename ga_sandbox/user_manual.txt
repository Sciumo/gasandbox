What should be improved:
-shared code (mainly OpenGL / UI stuff)
-each algebra all function in XXga_util.cpp
-clean up of left-over commented-out testing code


Especially c3ga.h is very large due to all the optimizations
for all examples (very varied use of GA).
Optimization are done from profile (.gp2)
If compile times are too long , copy the unoptimized .h and .cpp files
(e.g. c3ga.cpp and c3ga.h) from libgasandbox_no_opt to libgasandbox.
The examples will still work good enough without the optimizations.
