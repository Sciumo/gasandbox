Several libraries are required to build all examples. 
Most examples require only GLUT.
Below we list the libraries 
(with the version we used for testing in parentheses):


GLUT (3.8) / freeglut (2.4): required by nearly all examples
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

	The original GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit ) is not maintained anymore. 
	On top of that, it is not 'open' in a sense that you can modify & redistribute it.
	'freeglut' is a completely open source alternative to the GLUT.

FLTK (1.1.7): required by gaigenhp
http://www.fltk.org/

ANTLR (2.7.6): required by chap10ex3

OpenCV (0.9.7 beta5): required by chap10ex3, chap11ex2
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/

Qhull (2003.1): required by chap10ex3
