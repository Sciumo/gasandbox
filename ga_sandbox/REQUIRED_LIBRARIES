Several libraries are required to build all examples. 
Most examples require only GLUT.
Below we list the libraries 
(with the version we used for testing in parentheses):


GLUT (3.8) / freeglut (2.4): required by nearly all examples
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

	The original GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) is not maintained anymore. 
	On top of that, GLUT is not 'open': you are not allowed to modify & 
	redistribute GLUT (unless you happen to be Mark J Kilgard).
	'freeglut' is a completely open source alternative to the GLUT.

FLTK (1.1.7): required by gaigenhp
http://www.fltk.org/

ANTLR (2.7.6): required by chap10ex3, chap12ex3
http://www.antlr.org/

	If you link to libgasandboxparse, you need to link to ANTLR (libantlr), too.

OpenCV (0.9.7 beta5): required by chap10ex3, chap11ex2, chap11ex6, chap14ex4
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/

	We use OpenCV for its linear algebra implementation
	(SVD, eigenvalues, matrix inversion, etc)

Qhull (2003.1): required by chap14ex1
http://www.qhull.org/
	
	Building QHull caused us so much trouble -- both on Unix and Windows --
	that we decide to include the qhull distribution with this package.
	It recides in the qhull-2003.1 directory. We hope we do not violate 
	any rights of the QHull authors by redistributing it. 
	(The only  odifications we made are in the Makefiles and VS projects)
	(Why QHull? -> OpenCV has only 2D convex hull, we need 3D . . .)
