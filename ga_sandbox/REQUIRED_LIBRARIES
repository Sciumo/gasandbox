Several libraries are required to build all examples. 
Most examples require only GLUT.
Below we list the libraries 
(with the version we used for testing in parentheses):


GLUT (3.8) / freeglut (2.4): required by nearly all examples
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

	The original GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) is not maintained anymore. 
	On top of that, GLUT is not 'open' in a sense that you are not allowed
	to modify & redistribute it (unless you happen to beMark J Kilgard).
	'freeglut' is a completely open source alternative to the GLUT.

FLTK (1.1.7): required by gaigenhp
http://www.fltk.org/

ANTLR (2.7.6): required by chap10ex3
http://www.antlr.org/

OpenCV (0.9.7 beta5): required by chap10ex3, chap11ex2, chap11ex6
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/

Qhull (2003.1): required by chap14ex1
http://www.qhull.org/
	
	On Unix, just download and install qhull-2003.1.
	
	For windows, we provide a vs.net project in the directory 'qhull-2003.1'
	(as qhull itself does not provide this). 
	You should download the qhull-2003.1 sources yourself, and extract it to 
	this directory. Then build the library and copy the .libs and .h to where 
	the compiler can find them.
